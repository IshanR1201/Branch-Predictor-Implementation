# Branch-Predictor-Implementation
This report encapsulates three different types of branch predictions which were implemented using VHDL language.
We created these three predictors by using different types of functional small blocks which were then in turn used in the implementation of an improved processor for choosing conditional branches. The goal of this project is to measure the effectiveness of various types of branch predictions (taken or non taken) on several implementations of conditional branch instructions.
We write a program in C or C++ that implement the above mentioned three different branch prediction schemes. We understand the working and real time implementation of the predictors.
